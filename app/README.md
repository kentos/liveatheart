# Offical Live at Heart App

This is a React Native project which is distributed to iOS and Android.

This project is an ejected Expo project so it's up to you how you want to run it.

## API

There is not easy setup to point your local environment to your API at the moment. In `src/constants/config.ts` is where you set your local host for the app to send requests to.

## Disclaimer

I'm truly sorry of the messiness that occurs at places. But we can together make it better!
